# Car-Price-Prediction


Introduction:
The Car Price Prediction project is aimed at predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features like make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, etc. The project utilizes multilinear regression and boosting algorithms to train the model, and the final model is deployed using Django REST API. The user interface provides a simple way for users to input the features of a car and get the predicted selling price.


Data Collection: A CSV file containing information about used cars was collected. The file contains features like make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, selling price, etc.

Data Preprocessing: The data was preprocessed by removing any missing or invalid values, converting categorical variables to numerical variables, and scaling the data to bring all features to a similar range.

Model Selection: Multilinear regression was used to train the model as it is suitable for predicting the dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. Various boosting algorithms were used to improve the performance of the model, and the best one was selected based on evaluation metrics like R-squared value, mean absolute error, etc.

Model Deployment: The final model was deployed using Django REST API. The API allows users to input the features of a car and get the predicted selling price as output.

User Interface: A simple web-based user interface was created to allow users to easily input the features of a car and get the predicted selling price. The interface was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Testing and Validation: The model was tested and validated using a test dataset to ensure that it performs well on unseen data. The performance of the model was evaluated using various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Car Price Prediction project provides an efficient and reliable solution for predicting the selling price of used cars. By utilizing multilinear regression and boosting algorithms, the model is trained to accurately predict the selling price based on various features. The deployment of the model using Django REST API provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input the features of a car and get the predicted selling price. The project can be further improved by incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques and features to improve the accuracy of the model. Overall, the Car Price Prediction project is a useful tool for anyone looking to buy or sell a used car.
